# Tableau-Sales-Dashboard-for-Olist
In this project, I visualized key e-commerce insights using Tableau to drive data-driven decisions.
Here's a glimpse of what the dashboard offers:

➡️ A clear overview of Total Sales, Total Orders, Units Sold, and Total Freight Value, complete with monthly trends and year-over-year comparisons.
➡️ A breakdown of sales performance across different product categories with growth percentages.
➡️ An insightful donut chart showing the distribution of orders across various payment types.
➡️ A detailed map visualization showcasing sales distribution across different states, making it easy to identify regional trends.
➡️ A comprehensive table highlighting sales figures, YOY growth, units sold, and average freight value for top cities.
